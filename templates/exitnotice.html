                <h2>What is this server? Why is it sending traffic to me?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an Exit Node server for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Anonymity Network</a>, which is dedicated
                    to <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview">providing privacy</a> to people who need it most: average computer users
                </p>

                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <h2>Who runs this Tor exit server? I need to complain about problematic traffic!</h2>
                <p>This Tor exit node is operated by NODE_OPERATOR - which complies with the local laws of Sweden where the server is hosted.</p>
                <h4>
                But before you try and contact us, please read below to understand how Tor works, we cannot help you find the attacker, and we don't store
                any illegal content on this server. We simply act as a relay between Tor nodes and the internet - which is in our legal rights.
                </h4>
                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <p>
                    In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a
                    network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet
                    backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers
                    explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of
                    a packet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track
                    the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor
                    traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or
                    illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to
                    seize this router will accomplish nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being used to violate the DMCA, please 
                    be aware that this machine does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure
                    maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over theirequipment, in accordance with 
                    <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000512----000-.html">DMCA "safe harbor" provisions</a>. 
                    In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult
                    <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/eff/tor-dmca-response.html">EFF's prepared response</a> for more information on this matter.

                <h2>If Tor users are giving you a lot of problems, you can block them using the various tools made available by Tor:</h2>
                <p>
                    You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on the Tor network if you so desire.<br/>
                    The Tor project provides a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py">python script</a> to extract all IP 
                    addresses of Tor exit nodes. There's also an official <a href="http://exitlist.torproject.org/">DNSRBL</a> available 
                    to determine if a given IP address is actually a Tor exit server.<br/><br/>
                    
                    <strong>Please be considerate when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users 
                    access to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.</strong>
